# TimeTrades
With TimeTrades it is possible to retrieve both real-time and historical data from the stock exchange, for example to backtest algorithms or develop trading bots.

## What makes TimeTrades so special?
TimeTrades not only offers you the possibility to use already implemented APIs, but also allows you to integrate your own APIs in order to be as flexible as possible.

Statistical evaluations are also planned, which can be obtained directly from the retrieved data. 

Overall, TimeTrades is a wrapper that supports you in developing algorithms and bots without limiting your flexibility.
